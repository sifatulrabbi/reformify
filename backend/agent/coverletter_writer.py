I love building software and collaborating with awesome people. I often use Go, Python, or TypeScript to hack out most of my curiosities on Neovim. I enjoy exploring the tech world and practicing system design concepts, which makes me more focused on the overall system. I've helped rebuild HelloScribe AI's entire system in a more secure and scalable way.

My preferred working environment is a fast-paced SaaS startup. Moving as fast as possible, making decisions that will change the entire outcome of a software system, and collaborating with awesome engineers always excite me.

I love building software and collaborating with awesome people. Particularly, I dive into things I don't know and produce results. However, my attention span is limited to system design, server apps, web apps, and gen-AI. I enjoy exploring the tech world and mostly use Go, Python, and TypeScript to hack out my curiosities.

HelloScribe AI is an AI productivity tool that speeds up various planning and content-writing tasks. It provides an intuitive web app and utilizes LLM engines to aid in plan-making and content writing.

* Collaborated with the founders and led the team to develop better and more time-effective solutions to improve and evolve the system
* Developed a flexible algorithm for the HelloScribe agent, laid the groundwork to implement a dynamic UI component generator from the core LLM, and completed the dynamic HTML table generator
* Improved the core data pipeline of HelloScribe, enhancing performance from handling a few dozen concurrent requests to managing up to 5,000 concurrent requests
* Architected a flexible pay-as-you-go billing system
* Improved the data models and frontend UI structure for better performance and scalability
* Led the development process to rebuild HelloScribe AI with massive improvement and new features such as the agent mode, better text editor, improved security, and scalable backend architecture
* Enforced coding styles and consistencies across team members
* Utilized LLM services (OpenAI, Gemini) to produce content, and build the HelloScribe Agent
* Built an advanced logging system to log critical application logs to our Slack channel

X-Booker aims to streamline project management by combining most of the project management solutions into one single system with intelligent automation as well as providing an intuitive UI for easier navigation and business management.

* As the lead engineer, I worked closely with the founders to figure out technical solutions and the best way to materialize their vision
* Integrated various services such as Google Maps, Gmail, and Calendar into X-Booker's core API
* Architected a diverse system that uses background job processing, pub-sub, and a serverless approach to achieve various automation and data processing
* Built a flexible chat system with the ability to chat with individuals create groups, and share images, videos, and audio
* Architected a tier-based subscription system with buyable perks (extra storage or extra team seat)
* Built a complex but responsive, fast-loading, and secured dashboard, kanban board, email client, and file manager with different access levels (super admin, admin, and different types of teams)
* Architected a role-based auth system as well as an API integration so that the organizations can have direct external connections with other lead generation platforms
* Onboarded and mentored junior developers, in understanding the platform, and developing new features
* Developed an automated deployment pipeline to auto-deploy two different versions of the system on GCPâ€™s Kubernetes cluster
